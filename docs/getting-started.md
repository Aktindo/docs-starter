## Haha, docs go brrrrrr

Anyways this is a boilerplate I made for my projects (Aktindo) but... feel free to use it in your projects! I styled some stuff and that is the only difference so yeah!

## Installing

Type in these commands.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Aktindo/docs-starter.git
cd docs-starter
npm install
npm start
```

And the website should be live at http://localhost:3000.  
I would not give much more configuration since it is personally made for my projects but you can see https://docusaurus.io for more features.
